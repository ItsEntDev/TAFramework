Hi, dev here!
Just a few notes - see below!
This was written in .NET 6.0 for Long-term support. I'm not sure if it works in earlier versions. It might, but I wouldn't reccomend it.
This is NOWHERE near complete. Right now it is absolute barebones.

Other than that, public use. Do whatever you want.
